# 0x08. C - Recursion

# This project is about C - Recursion
/*
* What recursion is all about
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations one should implement recursion
* In what situations one shouldnâ€™t implement recursion
*/

# Requirements
/*
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Codes are written using the Betty style
